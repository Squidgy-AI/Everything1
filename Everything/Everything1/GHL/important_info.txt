1. Company
A company refers to an organization or entity engaged in business or commercial activities. It is the overarching entity that owns and operates under a brand or multiple brands.

Example:
Nestlé is a company. It is a global organization that operates various brands like KitKat, Nescafé, and Maggi.

2. Business Name
The business name is the name used by a company to conduct its operations, market its services or products, and engage with customers. A single company can have one or more business names, depending on how it structures its operations.

Example:
Under the company Nestlé, there are different business names:

Nescafé for coffee products
KitKat for chocolate products
Maggi for instant noodles
Even though these names are different, they all belong to the same parent company, Nestlé.

3. Contact
A contact is an individual who interacts with the company or business. Contacts can include customers, vendors, partners, or employees associated with a specific business name.

Example:

John Doe is a sales representative working for the business name Nescafé.
Jane Smith is a marketing manager for the business name Maggi.
Both John and Jane are contacts associated with the same parent company, Nestlé, but work under different business names.

Real-World Scenario:
If the system misidentifies similar business names, this could happen:

"Nescafe" (without the accent) and "Nescafé" (with the accent) might be treated as two different businesses.
A contact, John Doe, working under "Nescafe", would be listed under a separate company record from another contact, Jane Smith, working under "Nescafé".
This results in duplicate company records for what is essentially the same business, making it hard to manage data effectively.
By ensuring the system can handle such variations, you can consolidate the contacts under the correct parent company.

what is affiliate
ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
An affiliate is a business entity or individual that is associated with a larger organization or brand, typically to promote its products or services. Affiliates earn a commission or other benefits based on the performance of their promotional efforts, such as generating sales, leads, or traffic.

Affiliate in Business Context
Affiliates act as independent promoters who drive customers to a company, often through online platforms like websites, blogs, or social media. They are not employees of the company but work on a partnership basis.

Real-World Examples of Affiliates
1. Affiliate Marketing in E-commerce
Amazon Affiliate Program: Bloggers or influencers join the Amazon Associates program, receive unique tracking links for products, and earn a commission whenever someone makes a purchase through their link.
Example: A food blogger writes about kitchen gadgets and includes affiliate links to products on Amazon. If a reader buys a gadget via the link, the blogger earns a percentage of the sale.
2. Affiliates in Travel
Booking.com Affiliate Program: Travel websites or bloggers become affiliates by promoting hotel listings on Booking.com. When someone books a stay through their link, the affiliate earns a commission.
Example: A travel influencer posts a review of a resort and includes a Booking.com link for readers to book the same resort.
3. Affiliates in Software or Digital Products
Software Affiliates: Companies like Shopify or Adobe have affiliate programs where individuals or agencies promote their software. Affiliates earn a commission for every new user who signs up using their link.
Example: A YouTuber creates tutorials on setting up an online store and includes a Shopify affiliate link in the video description.
